# Space Invaders Game

This is a custom implementation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders, inspired by 'Vampire Survivors'. This project was created purely for fun and to explore some game development concepts using Java and the Swing library.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Emulates the traditional Space Invaders experience with waves of enemies.
- **Multiple Enemy Types**: Includes various types of invaders, each with unique behaviors. Note: Although some enemies have more HP than others, other differences are not yet implemented. :)
- **Power-Ups**: Gain different power-ups to enhance the player's firepower.
- **Boss Fights and Agents**: The game features challenging boss fights and agents that chase the player, adding extra layers of difficulty and excitement.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, which increases with difficulty.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Utilizes Java Swing for smooth graphics and animations.

## How to Play

- **Movement**: Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move left, right, up, and down.
- **Fire**: Press the `Spacebar` to shoot at the invading aliens.
- **Objective**: Destroy all aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
- **Other Key Bindings**: Use `F` and `U` to toggle agent firing on and off.
